<h2>How to change your local default version of R on the Iowa State University Statistics Department Linux servers</h2>

<h3>Edit (September 9, 2014)</h3>

<p>For these instructions to work, you'll need to make sure you're default shell is
<code>bash</code>. You may be using <code>ksh</code>, <code>tsh</code>,
or some other command line interface. To check, run</p>

<pre><code>ps -p $$
</code></pre>

<p>and you should see something like</p>

<pre><code>  PID TTY          TIME CMD
6453 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
</code></pre>

<p>The CMD column tells me I'm running <code>bash</code>, which is good.</p>

<p> If you're using a server at Iowa State,
you can change your default login shell this way:</p>

<ol>
<li>Log into <a href="https://asw.iastate.edu">ASW</a> (Account Services on the Web).</li>
<li>Click "Manage Net-ID".</li>
<li>Click "View/Edit your (Linux/Unix) login shell".</li>
<li>Select <code>/bin/bash</code> from the dropdown menu.</li>
<li>Click "Update Shell".</li>
<li>Close all instances your shell on the server.</li>
</ol>

<p>Other institutions should have something similar. Otherwise,
there are several pages on changing shells, including
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13046192/changing-default-shell-in-linux">
this one</a>.</p>

<p>The global default version of R on our Linux servers is outdated. 
When I open Terminal, log into linux11, and open R, I see that I'm 
running version 2.14.1.</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh landau@linux11.stat.iastate.edu -p 323
$ R

R version 2.14.1 (2011-12-22)

<p>Personally, I would rather use version 2.15.3, which is stored in /apps/R-2.15.3/bin/ on linux11.
I can open it manually with</p>

<pre><code>$ /apps/R-2.15.3/bin/R

<p>But wouldn't it be nice to just type 'R' and get version 2.15.3 
instead of 2.14.1? And what about Rscript? You can locally set both to 
version 2.15.3 with these steps.</p>

<ol>
<li>

<p>If you haven't done so already, open a command line interface program
like Terminal and log into one of the Linux servers.</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh [YOUR_ISU_ID]@linux11.stat.iastate.edu -p 323
</code></pre>

<p>Just one Linux server will do. The changes you make in the next
steps will carry over to the rest of the Linux servers.</p>

</li><br/>
<li><p>Change to your home directory if you're not there already.</p>
<pre><code>$ cd ~
</code></pre></li>

<li>
<p>Open your <code>.bashrc</code> file in a text editor.</p>

<pre><code>$ emacs .bashrc
</code></pre>

<p>For those of you who don't know, <code>emacs</code> is an old but still 
popular text editor that can be called from a command line 
interface program. <code>Vim</code> and <code>vi</code> are alternatives.</p>

<p>My <code>.bashrc</code> looks like this.</p>

<pre><code># .bashrc

# Source global definitions
if [ -f /etc/bashrc ]; then
  . /etc/bashrc
fi

# User specific aliases and functions
export PS1='`hostname` `echo \$PWD`> '
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=:/usr/local/cuda/lib64

export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/.local/lib/python2.6/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH

export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.rvm/bin # Add RVM to PATH for scripting
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
export PATH=$PATH:/apps/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/packages/ImageMagick-6.8.6-0/bin
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cuda/binlinux11.stat.iastate.edu
</code></pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>Locate the last appearance of "<code>export PATH</code>". Create a line below and
insert</p>

<pre><code>export PATH=/apps/R-2.15.3/bin:$PATH
</code></pre>

<p>For example, my <code>.bashrc</code> changes to</p>

<pre><code># .bashrc

# Source global definitions
if [ -f /etc/bashrc ]; then
  . /etc/bashrc
fi

# User specific aliases and functions
export PS1='`hostname` `echo \$PWD`> '
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=:/usr/local/cuda/lib64

export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/.local/lib/python2.6/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH

export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.rvm/bin # Add RVM to PATH for scripting
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
export PATH=$PATH:/apps/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/packages/ImageMagick-6.8.6-0/bin
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cuda/binlinux11.stat.iastate.edu
export PATH=/apps/R-2.15.3/bin:$PATH
</code></pre>

<p>If the version of R you want to use were stored in [SOME_OTHER_FOLDER],
you would instead insert</p>

<pre><code>export PATH=[SOME_OTHER_FOLDER]:$PATH
</code></pre>

</li>

<li>
<p>Save your changes to <code>.bashrc</code> and exit the text editor.
In emacs, you can do this by holding the control key and pressing
x, then s, then x, then c.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Log out of the Linux server and then log back in. Now, when you type in 'R'
or 'Rscript', version 2.15.3 will automatically load.</p>

<p>You have just changed the local default versions of R and Rscript 
on linux10, linux11, and impact1 through impact4.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Locally setting the version of R is a practical solution for an individual. 
However, as a department, we should talk about</p>

<ol>
<li>the <i>global</i> version of R we want to use right now.</li>
<li>how often we should update R.</li>
</ol>

<p>The IT guys want to help us, but as they say, we haven't given 
them a clear consensus. My vote is to switch to version 2.15.3 now 
and then update every year, skipping problematic versions like 
3.0.0. Feel free to discuss below.</p>
