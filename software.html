<h2><a href="https://github.com/wlandau/fbseq">fbseq</a></h2>

<p>
This <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> package toolkit is at the center of my PhD dissertation research.
It fits a hierarchical model to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-Seq">RNA-sequencing</a>
data and other high-dimensional count data
in fully Bayesian fashion via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo">Markov chain Monte Carlo</a> (MCMC). We
accelerated the MCMC using massively parallel, the machinery for which
is encapsulated in separate helper packages. The <a href="https://github.com/wlandau/fbseqCUDA/">fbseqCUDA</a>
package implements <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/about-cuda">GPU-accelerated</a> MCMC with tens of thousands of simultaneous threads,
and the <a href="https://github.com/wlandau/fbseqOpenMP/">fbseqOpenMP</a> implements
the same parallelism on a smaller scale using <a href="http://openmp.org">OpenMP</a>.
The publication of the method is pending, and my coauthors are Drs. <a href="http://jarad.me/">Jarad Niemi</a>
and <a href="http://www.public.iastate.edu/~dnett/">Dan Nettleton</a> of the
<a href="http://www.iastate.edu/">Iowa State University</a> <a href="http://stat.iastate.edu/">Department of Statistics</a>.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/wlandau/workflowHelper">workflowHelper</a></h2>

<p>
This <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> package is for anyone who uses
<a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> to analyze multiple datasets in multiple ways.
For a common set of use cases,
<a href="https://github.com/wlandau/workflowHelper">workflowHelper</a>
 makes it much easier to set up and maintain
a reproducible workflow in the midst of heavy development. For the full story and motivation, check
out the <a href="http://will-landau.com/2016/06/14/workflow.html">blog post</a>.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/wlandau/parallelRemake">parallelRemake</a></h2>

<p>
This <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> package implements parallel computing for
<a href="https://richfitz.github.io/">Rich Fitzjohn</a>'s
<a href="https://github.com/richfitz/remake">remake</a> package. For the full story and motivation, check
out the <a href="http://will-landau.com/2016/06/14/workflow.html">blog post</a>.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/wlandau/downsize">downsize</a></h2>

<p>
When I'm setting up a reproducible workflow in R, I don't run the full
scaled-up workflow right away. I first run a downsized version to test
and debug. This package helps with the downsizing. For more, see the
<a href="http://will-landau.com/2016/06/14/workflow.html">blog post</a>.
